# C++ Array Practice

This repository contains C++ programs and problems related to arrays.  
Arrays are one of the most important data structures in programming and form the base for many advanced concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Whatâ€™s inside

- Basic array declaration and initialization  
- Array input and output  
- Traversing arrays  
- Searching in arrays  
- Sorting arrays  
- Multi-dimensional arrays  
- Common array problems

New problems will be added regularly as I continue my practice.

## Why I built this repo

When learning DSA, arrays are the first data structure most programmers start with.  
By solving different array problems, I improved my understanding of:

- Memory storage of arrays  
- Loop-based problem solving  
- Common algorithms like searching and sorting  
- Logic building for competitive programming

I wanted to make this collection open so that others can also practice and learn.

## How to use this repo

- Clone or download the repository  
- Open the files in any C++ IDE or compiler (VS Code, CodeBlocks, Dev C++)  
- Run and understand each program  
- Try writing your own solutions for the same problems

## Who this is for

- Beginner C++ learners  
- Students preparing for coding interviews  
- Anyone practicing basic to intermediate DSA  
- Self-learners who want to strengthen programming logic

If you find this helpful, consider giving a star to this repository.  
I will be adding more array problems soon.
